      <h2>Why I Love It</h2>
      <p>
        I love hot yoga classes, especially CorePower Yoga. I usually attend the one in Back Bay, where the warm atmosphere and the welcoming community make every class feel special. 
        The heat, the music, and the flow of movement help me disconnect from daily stress and focus entirely on the present moment. I’ve also tried Solidcore and really enjoyed how challenging it is,
        it pushes me to build strength and endurance in ways that balance perfectly with my yoga practice. Both workouts have helped me feel stronger, more centered, and more confident in my body.

        One of the things that motivates me most is doing something that benefits me not only physically but also mentally. 
        I started getting into hot yoga because it clears my mind whenever I feel overwhelmed or anxious.
        It’s not just about flexibility or fitness for me, it’s about finding balance and learning how to let go.
        Every time I walk out of a class, I feel lighter, calmer, and more grounded. Over time, I’ve come to see yoga as a form of self-care and self-expression that keeps me connected to myself.
        What I love most is how much joy and creativity it brings into my life. Whether it’s learning new poses, connecting with others in class, or simply practicing alone, yoga always leaves me feeling inspired. 
        I’ve met amazing people through it and learned how consistency and mindfulness can truly change your day.

        Over time, I realized how much joy and creativity it brings into my life. 
        Whether it’s learning new techniques, collaborating with others, or just practicing on my own, 
        I find that every experience helps me grow. Here are a few things I really love about it:

      <ul>
        <li>Learning new skills and improving over time</li>
        <li>Connecting with a community of like-minded people</li>
        <li>Sweating out the pain</li>
      </ul>
