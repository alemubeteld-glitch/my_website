      <p>
        Hi there! My name is Betel, welcome to my personal website. I’m passionate about wellness, health, and creating balance in everyday life. 
        This website is a space where I share a bit of who I am and what inspires me to keep growing, learning, and staying grounded.
        Over the years, I’ve realized how much of an impact small, mindful choices can have on the way we feel, both physically and mentally. 
        Whether it’s through exercise, nutrition, or finding moments of calm in a busy day, I’ve learned that wellness isn’t about perfection; it’s about consistency and care. 
        I love exploring new workouts, trying healthy recipes, and finding ways to stay active that also bring me joy.
        Outside of fitness, I’m also interested in personal growth, mindfulness, and creativity. I believe that true health includes mental clarity and emotional balance, not just physical strength. 
        Yoga, meditation, and journaling have all played a big role in helping me feel more centered and confident in my daily life.
        My goal is to live in a way that feels intentional, energized, and positive — and I hope this website gives you a glimpse into that journey. 
        Thanks for stopping by and getting to know me!
